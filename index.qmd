# Pandora &  IsoMemo Computational Lab

The Pandora & IsoMemo Computational Lab provides access to a diverse range of computational tools, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), for data querying, manipulation, and modeling. The lab encompasses various types of models across numerous R and Python applications. These models, either already available or under development, are designed for studying complex systems such as network analysis, Bayesian analysis of differential equations, Agent-Based modeling, and Bayesian power law analysis. Additionally, the lab offers tools for time series analysis, such as Bayesian counterfactual analysis, Bayesian Point Break analysis, and AI-based tipping point detection. Other features include tools for spatiotemporal modeling and different types of causal analysis, such as Bayesian networks, Bayesian regression, and Bayesian model selection algorithms.

The currently available Pandora & IsoMemo software can be accessed on the Pandora & IsoMemo software platform on GitHub. Each software repository provides detailed instructions on installation and usage. All software features a user-friendly interface developed using Shiny technology. Many of the applications offer innovative self-developed modeling. In some instances, user-friendly interfaces along with novel modeling features were developed in collaboration with the developers of modeling software packages. In other cases, user-friendly interfaces were designed for software packages available under open licenses
