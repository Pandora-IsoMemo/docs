#  Docker - container port is already allocated

In case the following error occurs

```bash
docker: Error response from daemon: driver failed <...> Bind for 0.0.0.0:3838 failed: port is already allocated.
```

One must **stop the container that is still running**. This can be done as follows:

## 1. Check which container is running with:

```bash
docker ps
```
that list all running containers and should generate a similiar output like:

```bash
 CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                     COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS             PORTS                                       NAMES
 eddc62f0081d   ghcr.io/pandora-isomemo/osteo-bior:main   "Rscript -e OsteoBioâ€¦"   About an hour ago   Up About an hour   0.0.0.0:3838->3838/tcp, :::3838->3838/tcp   confident_colden
```
## 2. Stop the container using the `CONTAINER ID` (here: `eddc62f0081d`)

```bash
docker stop <YOUR_CONTAINER_ID>
```

## 3. Remove the container using the `CONTAINER ID`.

```bash
docker rm <YOUR_CONTAINER_ID>`
```

### 4. Check if no container is running anymore.

```bash
docker ps
```

The table should be empty now. Try to run the container.
