##  Docker - container port is already allocated

In case the following error occurs

```
docker: Error response from daemon: driver failed <...> Bind for 0.0.0.0:3838 failed: port is already allocated.
```

One must **stop the container that is still running**. This can be done as follows:

1. **Check** which container is running.  
  `docker ps` - list all running containers and should generate a similiar output like:
   ```
   CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                     COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS             PORTS                                       NAMES
   eddc62f0081d   ghcr.io/pandora-isomemo/osteo-bior:main   "Rscript -e OsteoBioâ€¦"   About an hour ago   Up About an hour   0.0.0.0:3838->3838/tcp, :::3838->3838/tcp   confident_colden
   ```
2. **Stop** the container using exactly the `CONTAINER ID` from above (here: `eddc62f0081d`).  
   `docker stop <YOUR_CONTAINER_ID>` - stops one or more running containers.
3. **Remove** the container using exactly the `CONTAINER ID`.  
   `docker rm <YOUR_CONTAINER_ID>` - remove one or more containers
4. **Check** if no container is running anymore.  
   `docker ps` - the table should be empty now.  
   Now try to run the container.
